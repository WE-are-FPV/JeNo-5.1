## Presentation
The JeNo is a 5.1" frame created for the release of the DJI Air Unit O3, which is not compatible with most of our frames. It was designed to ensure that the frame is not visible in the camera's field of view (FOV) while providing good lens protection. It is also compatible with the O3 camera's ND filters.

Originally intended for freestyle flying, flight quality and durability were at the core of its design (see BlackBox at the bottom of the page).

The issue of obstructed FOV due to spacers or the chassis is exacerbated with the O3 camera, but it was already present in many chassis with other cameras. The JeNo allows for a clear FOV with any camera and is not exclusively dedicated to the O3.

It is optimized for a 25° FOV but can support FOVs ranging from 0° to over 40°.

This new ability to film in 4K without needing an Action Cam saves between 70g (Action 2) and 165g (GoPro 11). For the standard version of the JeNo, we decided to add 20g to the chassis to have a rigid and solid tank, totaling up to 140g. However, it still allows for the option of carrying an Action Cam.

With a DJI Air Unit O3, you benefit from a lighter and more robust setup compared to traditional frames, with a clear FOV.

A Light version will allow you to maintain a more typical weight of 120g.

The JeNo was initially designed for Freestyle flying, which is why it features a "Wide-X" geometry. This design allows for good handling while reducing the number of visible propellers in the FOV compared to a "True-X" frame (though some propellers may still be visible). A "Cine" option provides elongated flat camera mounts for a "Wide" FOV without visible propellers.

Several pattern options for the arm "heads" are also available.

Finally, as this frame was designed by members of the WE are FPV community, a "WaF edition" is available (the logo is engraved on the bottom plate). Join us on the WAF forum in the official JeNo 5.1" thread to discuss it further.

The JeNo is also available in 3" and 3.5" versions, which can be found on this Printables page.
